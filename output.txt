Thetop-down approach (starting with, say, full forward secrecy)would tend to involve a more difficult proof but would havethe pleasing side-effect of guaranteeing all weaker secrecygoals by implication. Restrictions apply.of a temporal rank function that not only allows us to rea-son about what messages an attacker can deduce, but whenin the protocol he can deduce them. In this paper we have shown how forward secrecy prop-erties of crypto-protocols can be expressed and reasonedabout using rank functions. In general, a temporal rank function will bethree-valued if all compromised values are assumed to beleaked at the same time. This invites us to verify security protocols in asimilarly hierarchical way; either by working upwards fromsecrecy or downwards from some stronger condition. Bothof these examples considered a protocol running on an un-bounded network that allows principals to engage in arbi-trarily many protocol runs concurrently. If three ranks are indeed suf-ficient, then the theory presented above should almost cer-tainly be refined to reflect this fact.
